/**
 * There will probably be multiple game states.
 * Game states I have in mind:
 * - Undocked and flying in space and possibly in combat
 * - Docked to a station and navigating UI or walking around station
 * - Navigating main menu UI
 *
 * The whole point is that in these distinct gamestates, different types of objects will be coming into play
 * and the same objects may behave differently under different states.
 * With the different gamestate subclasses, we can change how the game behaves by overriding Tick().
